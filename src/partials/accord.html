            	<strong>My Bitcoin Story</strong><br/>
            	<span class="monospace">
          		When I first started with bitcoin it was confusing. I watched the video on bitcoin.org and from there linked to Coinbase.com. "<strong><i>Was Coinbase part of Bitcoin</i>?</strong>", "<strong><i>Was Bitcoin a company</i>?</strong> If so this is a confusing user experience!" 
          		<br/><br/>

          		I wasn't quite sure and so I started listening to the bitcoin podcasts, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/planb/">PlanB</a> and "<a target="_blank" href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/">Let's Talk Bitcoin</a>". From this I learned much and was confident there was a investment opportunity in bitcoin. I've been an entrepreneur all my adult life and knew this was a great chance to buy some bitcoin since the price at the time had just popped down from 1k to 600 per bitcoin. I signed up proper with Coinbase this time and verified my bank. Which took a couple days. After that I bought $300 worth of bitcoin at 700/bitcoin. This transaction, since it had to go through my bank, took a week, but finally I had my bitcoin. <br/><br/>

          		What could I do with it I thought? My relationship with <a target="_blank" href="https://cex.io/r/1/mikeumus/0/">CEX</a> was similar to Coinbase. It took me a while to warm up to it. What was a "Cloud Mining Share"? It read like a share that you owned of their bitcoin mining hardware that deposited returns in your account throughout the day. Genius! This is how I would store my bitcoins. I bought my first 7 GHS shares after transferring my bitcoin from Coinbase to my <a target="_blank" href="https://cex.io/r/1/mikeumus/0/">CEX</a> account and shortly after my mining shares came online on ghash.io. I was earning a return on the GHS shares I owned. <br/><br/>

          		<strong>How I Use Bitcoin</strong><br/>
          		<span class="monospace">
          		Since then I've started accepting bitcoin as payment at my web design/development business, <a target="_blank" href="http://massdistributionmedia.com/">MDM</a> and I'm not alone. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/bitcoin/indexus.asp?SRCCODE=WEBBP1792&cm_lm=kunalthechamp@hotmail.com&cm_mmc=email-_-Retro-_-WEBBP1792-_-tigeremail1792&utm_source=EML&utm_medium=main&utm_campaign=WEBBP1792&MobileOptOut=1">TigerDirect</a> now accepts bitcoin. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cheapair.com/blog/travel-news/book-your-flights-on-cheapair-with-bitcoin-virtual-currency/">CheapAir.com</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/bitcoins-in-space">Virgin Galactic</a> and the biggest, <a href="http://www.overstock.com/bitcoin">OverStock.com</a>.

Never one to follow the herd, I always dismissed bitcoins as a passing fad not giving it much attention. The volatility only scared me away until the recent price stability. I decided to invest my money in bitcoins and started looking for videos and tutorials online. None of the online resources were helpful and the complexity of the cryptocurrency kept me away until I stumbled upon a Facebook ad of bshares.co. I instantly picked up the phone and spoke with Mike. He guided me through the entire process and quelled all my doubts and answered all my questions patiently. I was finally armed with the knowhow I needed and am now a successful bitcoins investor. Thanks Mike!"
